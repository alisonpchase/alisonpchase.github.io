I study the microscopic life in the ocean on large spatial scales by combining knowledge from both ship-board measurements and satellite data. I am an optical oceanographer, which means that I use the color and brightness of the water to assess and understand the particles - notably phytoplankton - that are found there. 

I am currently a [Washington Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.wrfseattle.org/grants/fellows/) at the [Applied Physics Laboratory](https://www.apl.washington.edu/departments/airs/home.php) at the University of Washington.
